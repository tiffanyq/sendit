        <p> sendit allows you to make and send cards. it plays with laptops' physical resemblance to cards. try viewing a card! :)</p>
        <p>how do you feel about sending a card to someone like this vs. sending a physical card? what's the difference to you?</p>
        <p class="italicize">this was specifically designed with no backend. no data goes anywhere except for what you choose to send to others.</p>
